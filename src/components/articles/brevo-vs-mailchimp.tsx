        <h1><strong>Brevo vs Mailchimp: Which Email Platform Delivers Better Value in 2025?</strong></h1>
        <p><span className="drop-cap">C</span>hoosing between <strong>Brevo</strong> and <strong>Mailchimp</strong> is one of the most common decisions small business owners and marketers struggle with in 2025. Both platforms offer email marketing, automation, segmentation, and analytics—but the way they deliver these features is completely different. One focuses on automation and affordability, while the other focuses on branding, templates, and creative design. This guide breaks down every detail you need to make the right decision.</p>

        <div className="key-tip">
        <strong>Key Tip:</strong> Pick a platform based on your automation needs, not just templates. Automation impacts long-term results far more than email design.
        </div>

        <h2>Why This Comparison Matters</h2>
        <p>Email marketing has become extremely competitive, and choosing the wrong tool can slow down your growth. Businesses want automation that saves time, segmentation that improves targeting, and pricing that makes sense as subscribers grow. <strong>Brevo</strong> and <strong>Mailchimp</strong> both dominate the market, but they serve different types of users. This comparison explains real performance benchmarks and practical use cases so you can choose confidently.</p>
